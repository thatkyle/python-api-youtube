## Configuration Instructions
Add a .env file to the root project directory.

The .env file should contain the api key in the Google Developer API Key - Youtube record in LastPass. Ask the team lead to share this record with you if you don't already have it.

Your .env file should look like this:
api-token = "REPLACE_WITH_API_KEY"
